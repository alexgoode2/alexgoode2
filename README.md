I am a software development student at Promineo Tech. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and React.js are my tools as I will be working on the front end of software development. My interest for software development was sparked from the work I was doing as a graphic designer. At the time, I was working on graphics for a website and I found myself being interested in the development and structure of the overall site. I have a passion for technology, and for me this felt like I was working on the bigger picture. I plan on switching from graphic design to a full on career change as a software developer!
