I am a Front-End Software Development student at Promineo Tech. My studies there are focused in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and React.js. Over the span of 18 weeks, we will also be covering OOP, Design Patterns, Unit Testing, JQuery, AJAX, JSX, REST, NPM, AWS, and more! I have a background in graphic design and have always been a technology driven person. I am looking forward to a complete career change into front-end software development!
